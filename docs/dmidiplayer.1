Input MID/KAR/RMI/WRK file name(s).

.SH FILES
.TP
.B \f[I]*.lst\f[]
Playlist files.
The last opened or saved playlist file shall be remembered the next time
the program is started, but playlists are not saved automatically.
.RS
.PP
Playlists are simple text files, with a file name on each text line.
The file names can be relative to the location of the playlist file
itself (so they do not have an absolute path prepended) or each file can
have an absolute path on its own.
.PP
Users may have several playlists that can be created easily outside of
the program, for instance in the Linux command line this command creates
a playlist file named "my_playlist.lst" with all the MIDI files located
at the working directory:
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ ls\ \-1\ *.mid\ >\ my_playlist.lst
\f[]
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B \f[B]DRUMSTICKRT\f[]
