<h1 id="drumstick-multiplatform-midi-file-player">Drumstick Multiplatform MIDI File Player</h1>
<p>This application is a multiplatform MIDI file player for Linux, Windows and macOS. It reads .MID (Standard MIDI Files), .KAR (Karaoke), and .WRK (Cakewalk) file formats, and outputs MIDI events to hardware MIDI ports and also software synths.</p>
<p><a href="https://drumstick.sourceforge.io">Drumstick</a> is a set of GPLv3 licensed C++/Qt libraries for MIDI applications. The project includes several tools as examples, and among them is the drumstick-guiplayer utility that leverages the Drumstick::ALSA library, so it is available only for Linux (because the ALSA sequencer is a linux only technology). Some people have requested a program with the same functionalities on Windows and macOS, and here it is. But this program is much more than that, and also works on Linux...</p>
<p>Some key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIDI Output to hardware MIDI ports, or any other Drumstick backend like soft synths</li>
<li>Transpose song tonality between -12 and +12 semitones</li>
<li>Change MIDI volume level (using MIDI CC7)</li>
<li>Scale song speed between half and double tempo</li>
<li>Lyrics, Piano Player and MIDI Channels views</li>
<li>Supports MID/KAR (Standard MIDI Files) and WRK (Cakewalk) file formats</li>
</ul>
